# TicTacToe_JavaScript
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to take turns placing their respective symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
